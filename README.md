# Hotel-data-project
Project in SQL Server and Microsoft PowerBI.

Objective:

The aim of the project was to create a dashboard for analyzing hotel reservation data. The control panel answered the questions:

Is the hotel's annual revenue growing?
Should we increase number of parking lots?
What trends can we see in data?

Methods:

Reservation data was imported from a CSV file to a MySQL database. The data contained therein is extracted from the data needed to create the dashboard. The dashboard was created in Power BI.

Result:
The result of the project is an interactive PowerBI dashboard that answers the questions included, but you can also get a lot of other interesting information from it, such as the hotel's profits due to the country, the type of hotel and more.
